<p>With one truck and one employee, Teresa Nichols-Dotts, the "little girl" from Tennessee, incorporated in August 2000. Our first job was on US 19 and 54th Ave., S. for Ajax Paving in September 2000. With only a drive to succeed, Teresa obtained her Class B CDL during the first six months of operation so that she could double shift the sweeper and marketed EZ Sweep's service to the paving/milling industry and construction development companies.</p>

<p>In 2004 EZ Sweep diversified its service to include milling cleanup. This service has been a huge success allowing milling and paving companies to cleanup a milling project productively and cost effectively.</p>

<p>As we begin 2007, EZ Sweep provides customer service with six sweepers, two dump trucks, four bobcats w/planers, and eight broom tractors. Service is provided to the milling/paving industry, construction development companies, and roadway &amp; bridge sweeping for city, county and state governments throughout the State of Florida.</p>

<p>Each year EZ Sweep has been blessed to exceed our goals and this has been achieved by our trained, professional operators. Service is our motto and not one taken lightly. 98% of our growth has been from referrals.</p>
